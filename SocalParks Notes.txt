Language: Javascript
Create model: Mongoose 
Framework: express
HTML template: EJS

Error Handling
Data base: mongoDB- non SQL, flexible, not relational database, based on peices of data known as documents, similar to JSON objects, can be structured in whatever way we like.

Express session: npm i express-session
Setting up flash: which depends on session. npm i connect-flash

Authetication: Passport iauthentication middleware for Node.js
	      npm i passport passport-local passport-local-mongoose
hashing algorithm: Pbkdf2, not bcrypt
authentication from scratch - harder to modify if I want to add in more login methods.

Park author authentication:
add author to park schema, reseed the parks database with author;


Review author authentication:
	user side: ejs template to hide the delete button on show page;
	server side: isAuthor middleware (utils/auth)

Image upload: Multer - a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files

Cloudinary

Dotenv: to separate develop mode from user mode(not uploading things I don't want to show to everyone) It is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code

install cloudinary and multer-storage-cloudinary

Store uploaded image info in Mongo: We want - path & filename

console.log(req.files) 	You Get This:
{
    fieldname: 'image',
    originalname: 'IMG_5876.jpg',
    encoding: '7bit',
    mimetype: 'image/jpeg',
    path: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dlcyr32yry/image/upload/v1608320920/SocalParks/gcff6wgxrvgm69yh4ngo.jpg',
    size: 2773848,

  },

MVC design pattern: model - view - controller

Geocoding using MapBox + mapbox-sdk-js
